# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (fields/properties) and code (methods). OOP promotes **modularity, reusability, and maintainability** of code by organizing software into classes and objects.  
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., Car, Person).

- **Object**: An instance of a class.

### âœ… Benefits of OOP in C#
- Improved code organization.
- Easier maintenance and scalability.
- Promotes modular and reusable code.
- Aligns with real-world modeling.

## ðŸ”‘ Four Pillars of OOP in C#
| Concept | Description | C# Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal details and exposing only whatâ€™s necessary | Use of `private`, `public`, `internal`, `protected` access modifiers |
| **Abstraction** | Representing essential features without showing background details | Use of `abstract` classes, `interfaces` |
| **Inheritance** | Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse | Use of `:` syntax to inherit from a base class |
| **Polymorphism** | Ability for objects to take many forms, i.e., behave differently in different contexts | Use of method overriding (`virtual`, `override`) or overloading |

## Encapsulation
It refers to the **bundling of data (fields) and methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit (a class), while controlling the access to object's internal state through access modifiers.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals of Encapsulation
- **Protect internal state** of an object from unintended or harmful changes.
- **Provide controlled access** through methods or properties (getters/setters).
- **Improve maintainability** and modularity of the code.
- Support **data validation**, consistency, and integrity.

### âœ… Ways C# supports encapsulation:

#### 1. Access Modifiers  
These control the visibility of class members (fields, properties, methods, etc.) from other parts of the code.  
- `private`: Fields or methods are accessible only within the same class. This is the default for fields to hide them from external access.
- `public`: Members are accessible from everywhere. Used for methods that form the public interface.
- `protected`: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
- `internal`: Members are accessible within the same assembly.
- `protected internal`: Members are accessible within the same assembly or derived classes in other assemblies.
- `private protected`: Members are accessible only within the class and derived classes in the same assembly.  

By marking fields as `private` (or similar), you prevent direct external access, a core principle of encapsulation.  

```cs
class Car{
    private int speed; // Cannot be accessed directly outside

    public void SetSpeed(int value){
        if (value >= 0) speed = value;
    }

    public int GetSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }
}

```

#### 2. Properties
C# provides a cleaner syntax using properties with get/set accessors to encapsulate fields while still exposing them safely.  
```cs
class Car {
    private int _speed;

    public int Speed {
        get { return _speed; }
        set {
            if (value >= 0) _speed = value;
        }
    }
}

```
Or using **auto-implemented properties** with access control:
```cs
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; private set; } // Readable from outside, writable only inside
}

```

#### 3. Methods
Encapsulation often involves exposing functionality through **public methods**, while keeping the implementation **private**.  
```cs
class BankAccount {
    private decimal balance;

    public void Deposit(decimal amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    public decimal GetBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

#### 4. Interfaces and Abstraction
While abstraction and encapsulation are distinct, interfaces support encapsulation by hiding the classâ€™s internal details related to implementation.  
```cs
public interface ILogger {
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger {
    private string logFilePath = "log.txt"; // hidden implementation data

    public void Log(string message) {
        // writes to file
    }
}
```

#### 5. Private/Internal Classes and Nested Types
You can restrict access to certain classes entirely by marking them `private` or `internal`.
```cs
public class OuterClass {
    private class InnerHelper {
        public void DoWork() { }
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions
---
#### Q. What is encapsulation in OOP? How is it different from abstraction?
**Encapsulation** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components. Itâ€™s about hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access through well-defined interfaces, like public methods. This is often achieved using access modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public) to control visibility and ensure data integrity.  
> **Example**: In a `BankAccount` class, the balance is a private attribute. You can only modify it through public methods like `deposit()` or `withdraw()`, which enforce rules (e.g., no negative deposits). This protects the balance from being directly altered in an invalid way.

**Abstraction** in OOP is about hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object to the user. It focuses on *what* an object does, not *how* it does it, often achieved through abstract classes or interfaces.  
> **Example**: A `CoffeeMachine` interface might define a `brew()` method. The user doesnâ€™t need to know the internal mechanics (heating, grinding, etc.)â€”just that calling `brew()` makes coffee.  

Both concepts work together to make OOP systems modular, secure, and user-friendly, but they address different aspects of design.
- **Purpose**:
   - Encapsulation: Protects an objectâ€™s internal state by restricting access and bundling data with methods.
   - Abstraction: Simplifies interaction by hiding complex implementation details and showing only necessary functionality.

- **Focus**:
   - Encapsulation: Focuses on *data security* and bundling.
   - Abstraction: Focuses on *simplifying interaction* and reducing complexity.

**Analogy**:
- Encapsulation is like a locked safe: only specific keys (methods) can access the contents (data).
- Abstraction is like a carâ€™s dashboard: you see simple controls (steering, pedals) without needing to understand the engineâ€™s complexity.

---

#### Q. Why is encapsulation important?
Encapsulation enhances security, data integrity, maintainability, and modularity, making OOP systems more robust and easier to manage.  
> **Example**: In a `User` class, encapsulating a `password` field ensures it can only be modified through a `changePassword()` method that enforces security rules (e.g., minimum length, special characters). This protects the system from invalid or insecure password changes.

---

#### Q. Can you give an example of encapsulation in C#?
- **Private Fields**: The `balance` field is private, preventing direct access from outside the class.
- **Properties**: The `Balance` property provides controlled read/write access with validation. The `AccountHolder` property is read-only after initialization (`init`).
- **Public Methods**: Methods like `Deposit` and `Withdraw` expose functionality while enforcing rules, keeping the internal state consistent.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the object in a valid state, further supporting encapsulation by ensuring proper setup.

---

#### Q. What is the default access modifier for class members in C#? Why is that important for encapsulation?
The default access modifier for class members in C# is `private`. This means that if no access modifier is specified, the member is only accessible within the same class.  
This is important for encapsulation because it ensures that class members are not accessible from outside the class, protecting the internal state of the object and preventing unintended interference.

---


#### Q. How do properties support encapsulation in C#?
Properties in C# are a key mechanism for supporting **encapsulation** by providing controlled access to a classâ€™s private fields while maintaining the principles of data hiding and abstraction. They allow a class to expose its data in a safe, flexible, and maintainable way, combining the benefits of direct field access with the ability to enforce validation, logic, or restrictions.  

**1. Controlled Access to Private Fields:**   
Properties act as an intermediary between a classâ€™s private fields and external code. By keeping fields `private` and exposing them through properties, you prevent direct access to the internal state, ensuring data integrity.  
```cs
public class Person
{
    private string name; // Private field

    // Property to control access to name
    public string Name
    {
        get => name; // Allow reading
        set => name = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) ? value : throw new ArgumentException("Name cannot be empty.");
    }
}
```
Here, the `Name` property ensures the `name` field cannot be set to an empty or null value, enforcing validation.  

**2. Hiding Implementation Details:**  
Properties allow a class to hide how data is stored or computed. External code interacts with the property as if it were a field, but the class can include logic in the getter or setter without exposing it.
```cs
public class Circle
{
    private double radius;

    public double Radius
    {
        get => radius;
        set => radius = value >= 0 ? value : throw new ArgumentException("Radius cannot be negative.");
    }

    public double Area
    {
        get => Math.PI * radius * radius; // Computed property, no backing field
    }
}
```
The `Area` property is read-only and computed on demand, hiding the calculation logic while encapsulating the `radius` field.

**3. Flexible Access Control:**  
Properties allow fine-grained control over read and write operations. You can make a property read-only (`get` only), write-only (`set` only), or restrict one of them to private/protected access.
```cs
public class BankAccount
{
    private double balance;

    public double Balance
    {
        get => balance; // Public read access
        private set => balance = value >= 0 ? value : throw new ArgumentException("Balance cannot be negative.");
    }

    public void Deposit(double amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
            Balance = balance + amount; // Uses private setter
    }
}
```
The `Balance` property allows public reading but restricts modifications to within the class, ensuring controlled updates via methods like `Deposit`.  

**4. Encapsulation Without Changing Interface:**  
Properties allow you to change the internal implementation (e.g., how data is stored or computed) without altering the public interface. External code continues to access the property as if it were a field.
```cs
public class Employee
{
    private string firstName;
    private string lastName;

    public string FullName
    {
        get => $"{firstName} {lastName}"; // Combines two fields
        set
        {
            var parts = value.Split(' ');
            if (parts.Length >= 2)
            {
                firstName = parts[0];
                lastName = parts[1];
            }
            else
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Full name must include first and last names.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
External code uses `FullName` as a single property, unaware of the two underlying fields (`firstName`, `lastName`). If the storage changes (e.g., to a single field), the propertyâ€™s interface remains unchanged.  

**5. Auto-Implemented Properties for Simplicity:**  
For simple cases where no additional logic is needed, C# provides **auto-implemented properties**, which automatically create a private backing field. This simplifies code while maintaining encapsulation.
```cs
public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; } // Auto-implemented property
    public decimal Price { get; private set; } // Read-only externally

    public void UpdatePrice(decimal newPrice)
    {
        if (newPrice >= 0)
            Price = newPrice;
    }
}
```
The `Price` property is read-only outside the class, and updates are controlled via `UpdatePrice`, ensuring encapsulation.

**6. Support for Immutability:**  
Using `init`-only properties (introduced in C# 9.0), you can create immutable objects where properties can only be set during object initialization, further enhancing encapsulation by preventing unintended changes.
```cs
public class Order
{
    public int OrderId { get; init; } // Can only be set during initialization
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; init; }
}
```

#### Q. Whatâ€™s the difference between a field and a property in terms of encapsulation? ####  
A **field** is a variable directly declared within a class or struct, typically used to store the internal state of an object.  
A **property** is a class member that provides a controlled interface to access or modify a field (or computed data) through getter and setter methods.  

| Aspect                  | Field                                  | Property                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**      | Direct access unless private; no fine-grained control. | Controlled access via `get`/`set`, can be read-only, write-only, or restricted (e.g., `private set`). |
| **Data Hiding**         | Private fields hide data, but public fields expose it completely. | Properties hide the backing field and expose only the intended interface. |
| **Validation/Logic**    | No built-in way to validate or add logic when accessing/modifying. | Getters/setters can include validation, computation, or side effects. |
| **Interface Stability** | Changing a public field to a property breaks the public interface (binary compatibility issue). | Properties maintain a stable interface, allowing internal changes without affecting external code. |
| **Encapsulation Level** | Basic encapsulation with private fields; none with public fields. | Strong encapsulation, even with public properties, due to controlled access and logic. |

---

#### Q. What access modifier would you use for a variable that should only be modified inside the class? ####  
Use the `private` access modifier for a variable that should only be modified inside the class, and optionally expose controlled access via methods or a **property with a private setter**.

---

#### Q. When would you make a property read-only or write-only? ####  
**Read-Only Properties:** Use when you want to allow reading but prevent modification, ensuring immutability, computed values, or controlled state exposure. Implemented with `get` only, `private set`, or `init`.  
**Write-Only Properties:** Use for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, security tokens) or action-triggering scenarios (e.g., logging, updating internal state) where reading is unnecessary or restricted. Implemented with `set` only.

---

#### Q. How do auto-implemented properties relate to encapsulation? ####  
Auto-implemented properties allow you to define a property with a `get` and/or `set` accessor without manually declaring a private backing field. The compiler creates an anonymous private field behind the scenes.  
Syntax: 
```cs
public class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; } // Auto-implemented property
}
```
In this example, the compiler generates a private field (e.g., `<>_name`) and implements the `get` and `set` accessors to interact with it.  

Auto-implemented properties enhance encapsulation in C# by:
- Hiding the compiler-generated private backing field, preventing direct access.
- Allowing controlled access through `get`, `set`, `private set`, or `init` modifiers.
- Maintaining a stable public interface that can be refactored to include logic later.
- Simplifying code while preserving encapsulation principles.  

However, they are best suited for simple scenarios without validation or computed values. For complex logic, manual properties are needed, but auto-implemented properties still provide a strong foundation for encapsulation by ensuring data is accessed through a controlled interface rather than directly via fields.

---

#### Q. How would you refactor a class that exposes all its fields as public? ####
To refactor a class with public fields in C# for encapsulation:  
1. Change public fields to `private`.
2. Replace fields with properties (auto-implemented or manual with validation).
3. Add methods for controlled modifications (e.g., `Deposit` for `Balance`).
4. Use `init` or `private set` for immutability or restricted access.
5. Keep property names same as fields for compatibility.

---

#### Q. How can encapsulation help in a team environment when multiple developers are working on the same codebase? ####
Encapsulation enhances collaboration in a team environment with multiple developers by promoting **modularity**, **data protection**, and **clear interfaces**, which reduce errors, simplify maintenance, and improve code reliability.  
Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of how encapsulation helps:  
1. Prevents Unintended Modifications:  
A `BankAccount` class with a private `balance` field and public `Deposit`/`Withdraw` methods ensures teammates canâ€™t set `balance` to invalid values.
2. Reduces Conflicts:  
Changing how `balance` is calculated in a `BankAccount` class doesnâ€™t affect code using its public `Balance` property.
3. Improves Maintainability:  
Validation in a property setter (e.g., `private set` for `Balance`) ensures consistent behavior across the teamâ€™s code.
4. Facilitates Division of Work:  
One developer can work on a `Customer` class while another works on a `BankAccount` class, relying on each otherâ€™s public methods without interference.
5. Enhances Code Reusability:  
A `Logger` class with a write-only `Message` property can be reused by multiple developers without exposing its logging mechanism.

---

#### Q. Can encapsulation help prevent breaking changes in APIs? How? ####  
- **Library Development**: In a library, encapsulation ensures clients depend only on public properties/methods, allowing internal refactoring without forcing clients to update.
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the APIâ€™s internals without affecting its public contract, reducing coordination overhead.
- **Long-Term Maintenance**: Encapsulation makes it easier to evolve the API (e.g., adding features, optimizing performance) while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

#### Q. What are the drawbacks of too much encapsulation? ####
1. Reduced Flexibility:  
Overly restrictive access (e.g., making everything `private` with no public interface) can hinder legitimate use cases, forcing developers to write workarounds or duplicate code to access needed data.  
**Example**: If a `Balance` property is private with no getter, other classes may need to implement redundant logic to estimate the balance, reducing code reuse.

2. Performance Overhead:  
Wrapping every field access in properties or methods with validation or logic can introduce slight performance costs, especially in performance-critical applications where simple field access would be faster.  

3. Boilerplate Code:  
Over-encapsulation can lead to excessive boilerplate (e.g., getters/setters for every field), increasing code volume and maintenance effort without adding meaningful value.  
**Example**: Auto-implemented properties (`public string Name { get; set; }`) are often sufficient, but over-encapsulation might lead to manual properties with redundant validation for every field.

4. Testing Challenges:  
Excessive encapsulation can make unit testing harder, as private fields and methods are inaccessible. Developers may need to use reflection or expose internal state unnecessarily to test the class.  
**Example**: A private field with no getter requires complex test setups to verify the internal state, increasing test complexity.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a principle that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a class while exposing only the essential features or behaviors to the outside world. It allows developers to work with simplified models of objects, focusing on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals of Abstraction
- **Hide Implementation Details**:
  - Users of a class donâ€™t need to know how methods or properties work internally.
  - They only interact with a **clear, defined interface**.
  - *Example*: You can use a `List<T>` without knowing how it resizes internally.
- **Reduce Complexity**:
  - By focusing only on **what** an object does, not **how**, the system becomes easier to understand and manage.
  - *Like a remote control*: You press a button â€” you donâ€™t worry about how the signal is processed.
- **Improve Code Maintainability**:
  - Changes to internal logic can be made **without affecting** the classes or code that use it â€” as long as the interface contract remains the same.
- **Enhance Code Reusability**:
  - Abstract structures (like abstract classes or interfaces) can be reused across multiple implementations.
  - *Example*: Interface `ILogger` can be implemented by `FileLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`, etc.
- **Enable Loose Coupling**:
  - Abstraction decouples high-level logic from low-level implementation.
  - Makes code **more modular** and easier to replace or extend.
  - *Example*: Switching from one database to another by abstracting the data access layer.
- **Support Polymorphism**:
  - Abstraction (through interfaces or base classes) enables objects to be used interchangeably via a common type.
  - *Example*: A method that accepts a `Shape` can work with `Circle`, `Square`, etc., without knowing their specific types.

### âœ… Ways C# supports abstraction:

#### 1. Abstract Classes 
- Define a base class with common functionality, leaving some members unimplemented for derived classes.
- Cannot be instantiated directly.
```cs
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound(); // Abstract method
    public void Breathe() => Console.WriteLine("Breathing...");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine("Bark!");
}

```

#### 2. Interfaces
- Define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
- No implementation (prior to C# 8.0); just signatures.
```cs
public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving car...");
}
```

#### 3. Access Modifiers (Encapsulation aiding Abstraction)
- Hide internal class members and expose only what's needed.
- `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`, `private protected`
```cs
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Hidden implementation
    public void Deposit(decimal amount) => balance += amount; // Public API
}
```

#### 4. Delegates and Events
Delegates and events allow you to abstract method invocation so that caller doesn't know who handles the operation.
```cs
public delegate void Notify();  // Delegate declaration

class Process
{
    public event Notify ProcessCompleted;  // Event using delegate

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Process started...");
        // Some logic
        ProcessCompleted?.Invoke();  // Raise event
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Process p = new Process();
        p.ProcessCompleted += () => Console.WriteLine("Process completed.");
        p.Start();
    }
}
```

#### 5. Virtual Methods and Method Overriding
- Virtual methods allow derived classes to override base class implementations, enabling abstraction by letting subclasses redefine behavior while adhering to a common interface.
- **Use Case**: To provide a default implementation that can be customized by derived classes.
```cs
class Vehicle
{
    public virtual void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle starting...");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car engine revving!");
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions

#### Q. What is an abstract class? Can it have concrete methods? Can it have constructors?  
An abstract class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for derived classes. It is designed to define common behavior and structure for a group of related classes, often encapsulating shared functionality while leaving specific implementations to subclasses. Abstract classes are declared using the `abstract` keyword and are used to achieve abstraction in object-oriented programming by focusing on "what" a class does rather than "how" it does it.  

- Key Characteristics:
  - Cannot be instantiated (e.g., `new AbstractClass()` is not allowed).
  - Can contain **abstract members** (methods, properties, etc.) that have no implementation and must be implemented by derived classes.
  - Can contain **concrete members** (methods, properties, fields, etc.) with full implementations.
  - Used as a base class for inheritance.
  
```cs
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound(); // Abstract method (no implementation)
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}

// Usage
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.MakeSound(); // Output: Woof!
// Animal animal = new Animal(); // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
```

An abstract class can have **concrete methods** (methods with full implementation). These methods provide shared functionality that derived classes can use as-is or override (if marked as `virtual`). This allows abstract classes to define common behavior while still enforcing abstraction for specific methods.
```cs
abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void StartEngine(); // Abstract method
    public void Stop() // Concrete method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car engine started.");
    }
}

// Usage
Car car = new Car();
car.StartEngine(); // Output: Car engine started.
car.Stop();        // Output: Vehicle stopped.
```

An abstract class can have **constructors**, which are used to initialize fields or properties when a derived class is instantiated. Since an abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, its constructor is called by the derived class' constructor (explicitly or implicitly). Constructors in abstract classes are typically used to enforce initialization logic for shared fields.
```cs
abstract class Shape
{
    protected string color;
    public Shape(string color) // Constructor
    {
        this.color = color;
    }
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
    public void DisplayColor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Color: {color}");
    }
}

class Rectangle : Shape
{
    private double width, height;
    public Rectangle(string color, double width, double height) : base(color)
    {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Usage
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle("Blue", 5, 3);
rect.DisplayColor(); // Output: Color: Blue
Console.WriteLine(rect.CalculateArea()); // Output: 15
```
The abstract class `Shape` has a constructor that initializes the `color` field. The `Rectangle` class calls this constructor using `base(color)` to ensure the `color` field is set when a `Rectangle` object is created.

---

#### Q. What is an interface? Can a class implement multiple interfaces?  
An interface in C# is a contract that defines a set of methods, properties, events, or indexers that a class or struct must implement, without providing any implementation details. It focuses on "what" must be done, not "how" it is done, promoting abstraction and loose coupling in object-oriented programming. Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword and are typically used to ensure that different classes adhere to a common set of behaviors.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Contains only member declarations (no implementation until C# 8.0 introduced default implementations, which are rarely used).
  - Cannot be instantiated directly.
  - Classes or structs that implement an interface must provide implementations for all its members.
  - Supports polymorphism by allowing objects to be treated as the interface type.
```cs
interface IAnimal
{
    void MakeSound(); // Method signature
    string Name { get; set; } // Property signature
}

class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}

// Usage
IAnimal dog = new Dog { Name = "Buddy" };
dog.MakeSound(); // Output: Woof!
Console.WriteLine(dog.Name); // Output: Buddy
```

A class in C# can implement **multiple interfaces**. This is a key feature that allows a class to conform to multiple contracts, enabling flexible design and supporting multiple behaviors. Unlike inheritance, where a class can only inherit from one base class, a class can implement any number of interfaces by separating them with commas in the class declaration.
- Key Points:
  - Each interfaceâ€™s members must be implemented by the class.
  - Multiple interface implementation is useful for combining unrelated behaviors (e.g., a class can be both `IDisposable` and `IComparable`).
  - If interfaces have conflicting member names, explicit interface implementation can be used to resolve ambiguity.
```cs
interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

interface IScanner
{
    void Print();
}

class MultiFunctionDevice : IPrinter, IScanner
{
    void IPrinter.Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing document...");
    }

    void IScanner.Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing scanned image...");
    }
}

// Usage
MultiFunctionDevice device = new MultiFunctionDevice();
((IPrinter)device).Print(); // Output: Printing document...
((IScanner)device).Print(); // Output: Printing scanned image...
```

#### Q. When would you use an abstract class instead of an interface?
An abstract class is used instead of an interface when you want to provide a common base with shared implementation, state, or behavior that derived classes can inherit. Here are some scenarios where an abstract class is preferred over an interface:  

**1. Shared Implementation**:  
Abstract classes can contain concrete methods, fields, and properties with shared implementation, which derived classes can use or override.  
Interfaces (prior to C# 8.0) only define contracts without implementation, and even with default implementations in C# 8.0+, they are less suited for sharing complex logic.
```cs
abstract class Vehicle
{
    protected int speed; // Shared state
    public void Stop() // Shared concrete method
    {
        speed = 0;
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
    public abstract void Drive(); // Abstract method for specific behavior
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Drive()
    {
        speed = 60;
        Console.WriteLine($"Car driving at {speed} km/h.");
    }
}

// Usage
Car car = new Car();
car.Drive(); // Output: Car driving at 60 km/h.
car.Stop();  // Output: Vehicle stopped.
```
The `Stop` method and `speed` field are shared across all `Vehicle` types, avoiding code duplication. An interface would require each class to implement `Stop` independently.

**2. State Management**:
Abstract classes can maintain state through fields (e.g., private or protected variables), properties, or methods, allowing derived classes to inherit and manipulate shared data.
Interfaces cannot hold state; they only define behavior.
```cs
abstract class Shape
{
    protected string color; // Field to store state
    public Shape(string color)
    {
        this.color = color;
    }
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
    public string GetColor() => color; // Shared method
}

class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;
    public Circle(string color, double radius) : base(color)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Usage
Circle circle = new Circle("Red", 5);
Console.WriteLine(circle.GetColor()); // Output: Red
Console.WriteLine(circle.CalculateArea()); // Output: 78.54
```
The `color` field and `GetColor` method are shared, and the constructor enforces initialization. An interface cannot store fields or enforce such initialization.

**3. Access Modifiers**:
Abstract classes can use access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `internal`, etc.) to control visibility of members, allowing finer control over encapsulation. Interfaces typically have public members (implicitly or explicitly).
```cs
abstract class Appliance
{
    protected bool isOn; // Protected field
    protected void Reset() // Protected method
    {
        isOn = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Appliance reset.");
    }
    public abstract void Operate();
}

class Fan : Appliance
{
    public override void Operate()
    {
        isOn = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Fan is spinning.");
    }
    public void Stop()
    {
        Reset(); // Access protected method
        Console.WriteLine("Fan stopped.");
    }
}

// Usage
Fan fan = new Fan();
fan.Operate(); // Output: Fan is spinning.
fan.Stop();    // Output: Appliance reset. Fan stopped.
```
The `Reset` method is `protected`, accessible only to derived classes, ensuring controlled access. Interfaces cannot have protected members. 

> However, with C# 8.0 and later, default interface implementations allow for `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `public`, `virtual`, `abstract`, `sealed`, `static`, `extern`, and `partial` modifiers on members under specific conditions.  
> For example, a private method with a default implementation can be added to an interface.

#### Q. What is the use of protected members in C# interfaces?
In C# 8.0 and later, interfaces can have protected members.  
However, unlike classes, where protected allows access within the same class and derived classes, the purpose and usage of protected members in interfaces are a bit different.  
- **Access is limited to derived interfaces, not derived classes**: A `protected` member in an interface can only be accessed by interfaces that inherit from it. Classes that implement the interface cannot directly access these `protected` members.
- **Explicit implementation required**: When a class implements an interface with `protected` members, it needs to explicitly implement those members, meaning the implementation must be qualified with the interface name.  
  
**Potential Use Cases**  
While less common than in classes, `protected` interface members can be useful in **scenarios involving interface hierarchies** where you want to provide helper methods or properties that are only relevant to the internal implementation details of derived interfaces.  
For example, consider a situation where you have a base interface `IInventoryController` with a `protected` method `PullInventoryItem()`. Derived interfaces could then utilize this protected method for their internal logic, without exposing it to classes that simply implement the interface.  

> The primary purpose of interfaces remains defining contracts and abstracting behavior. Overusing default implementations and `protected` members might make interfaces behave more like abstract classes, potentially blurring the lines between these two concepts.

#### Q. Can an abstract class implement an interface?
- Yes, An abstract class can implement some or all of the interface's members (methods, properties, etc.).
- If the abstract class does not implement all interface members, it must declare the unimplemented members as `abstract`, and derived classes must provide the implementations.
- This approach combines the benefits of interfaces (defining contracts) with abstract classes (shared state and implementation).

**1. Abstract Class Fully Implements the Interface**  
The abstract class provides concrete implementations for all interface members, and derived classes inherit these implementations.
```cs
interface IDrawable
{
    void Draw();
}

abstract class Shape : IDrawable
{
    protected string color;
    public Shape(string color)
    {
        this.color = color;
    }
    public void Draw() // Concrete implementation of interface method
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing a {color} shape.");
    }
}

class Circle : Shape
{
    public Circle(string color) : base(color) { }
}

// Usage
Circle circle = new Circle("Red");
circle.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a Red shape.
```
**Explanation**: The `Shape` abstract class implements the `IDrawable` interface by providing a concrete `Draw` method. The `Circle` class inherits this implementation without needing to override it.  

**2. Abstract Class Partially Implements the Interface**  
The abstract class implements some interface members and leaves others as abstract, requiring derived classes to implement them.
```cs
interface IVehicle
{
    void Start();
    void Stop();
}

abstract class Vehicle : IVehicle
{
    protected string model;
    public Vehicle(string model)
    {
        this.model = model;
    }
    public void Stop() // Concrete implementation
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{model} stopped.");
    }
    public abstract void Start(); // Abstract method for interface member
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public Car(string model) : base(model) { }
    public override void Start() // Must implement the abstract method
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{model} engine started.");
    }
}

// Usage
Car car = new Car("Toyota");
car.Start(); // Output: Toyota engine started.
car.Stop();  // Output: Toyota stopped.
```
**Explanation**: The `Vehicle` abstract class implements the `IVehicle` interface, providing a concrete `Stop` method but leaving `Start` as abstract. The `Car` class must implement `Start`.  

**3. Abstract Class Implements Multiple Interfaces**  
An abstract class can implement multiple interfaces, either fully or partially, just like any other class.
```cs
interface IMovable
{
    void Move();
}

interface IDescribable
{
    string GetDescription();
}

abstract class Animal : IMovable, IDescribable
{
    protected string name;
    public Animal(string name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void Move() // Concrete implementation
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is moving.");
    }
    public abstract string GetDescription(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public Dog(string name) : base(name) { }
    public override string GetDescription()
    {
        return $"A dog named {name}.";
    }
}

// Usage
Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.Move(); // Output: Buddy is moving.
Console.WriteLine(dog.GetDescription()); // Output: A dog named Buddy.
```
**Explanation**: The `Animal` abstract class implements both `IMovable` and `IDescribable` interfaces, providing a concrete `Move` method and leaving `GetDescription` as abstract for derived classes like `Dog` to implement.
