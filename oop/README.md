# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (fields/properties) and code (methods). OOP promotes **modularity, reusability, and maintainability** of code by organizing software into classes and objects.  
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., Car, Person).

- **Object**: An instance of a class.

### âœ… Benefits of OOP in C#
- Improved code organization.
- Easier maintenance and scalability.
- Promotes modular and reusable code.
- Aligns with real-world modeling.

## ðŸ”‘ Four Pillars of OOP in C#
| Concept | Description | C# Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal details and exposing only whatâ€™s necessary | Use of `private`, `public`, `internal`, `protected` access modifiers |
| **Abstraction** | Representing essential features without showing background details | Use of `abstract` classes, `interfaces` |
| **Inheritance** | Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse | Use of `:` syntax to inherit from a base class |
| **Polymorphism** | Ability for objects to take many forms, i.e., behave differently in different contexts | Use of method overriding (`virtual`, `override`) or overloading |
